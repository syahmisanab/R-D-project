## üîç Concept: How WS2812B Works  

The **WS2812B LED strip**, also known as **NeoPixel**, is a type of addressable RGB LED strip. Each LED can be controlled individually using a **single data pin**.  

‚úÖ **How It Works:**  
- Each LED has a **tiny microcontroller** inside that controls its color.  
- The Raspberry Pi sends color data to the first LED, which then passes the data to the next one, and so on.  
- We use the **Adafruit NeoPixel library** to control the LEDs with Python.  

‚úÖ **Why Use WS2812B?**  
‚úî Only **one GPIO pin** is needed for multiple LEDs.  
‚úî Supports **cool lighting effects** like color waves, rainbow cycles, and animations.  
‚úî Each LED can have **independent brightness and color settings**.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide  

### **Step 1: Install Required Libraries**  
Before running the code, install the **Adafruit NeoPixel library**:  

```bash
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel
```

---

### **Step 2: Write the Python Code**  

üìú **Save the following script as** `neopixel.py`:  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Necessary Libraries**  
```python
import time
import board
import neopixel
```
‚úÖ **time**: Used for adding delays between color changes.  
‚úÖ **board**: Helps define the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.  
‚úÖ **neopixel**: The library that controls the LED strip.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ LED Strip Configuration**  
```python
LED_PIN = board.D18  # GPIO 18 (OiviO Pi Extension Board)
NUM_LEDS = 8         # Change this to the number of LEDs in your strip
BRIGHTNESS = 0.5     # Brightness level (0.0 - 1.0)
ORDER = neopixel.GRB # Color order for WS2812B
```
‚úÖ **LED_PIN**: The GPIO pin used to send data to the LED strip (**GPIO 18 - Pin 12**).  
‚úÖ **NUM_LEDS**: The number of LEDs in the strip (change if needed).  
‚úÖ **BRIGHTNESS**: Controls the brightness level of the LEDs. A value of `1.0` is full brightness.  
‚úÖ **ORDER**: Defines the color sequence (**GRB is standard for WS2812B**).  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the LED Strip**  
```python
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(LED_PIN, NUM_LEDS, brightness=BRIGHTNESS, auto_write=False, pixel_order=ORDER)
```
‚úÖ This creates a **NeoPixel object** that allows us to control the LEDs.  
‚úÖ `auto_write=False` means we need to call `pixels.show()` to update the LEDs.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Define a Function to Cycle Colors**  
```python
def color_cycle(wait=0.5):
    colors = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]  # Red, Green, Blue
    for color in colors:
        pixels.fill(color)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)
```
‚úÖ The function cycles through **red, green, and blue** colors.  
‚úÖ `pixels.fill(color)`: Fills the entire LED strip with the selected color.  
‚úÖ `pixels.show()`: Updates the LEDs to display the new color.  
‚úÖ `time.sleep(wait)`: Adds a short delay before changing to the next color.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Main Loop to Run the Animation**  
```python
try:
    while True:
        color_cycle()
```
‚úÖ **while True** keeps the script running indefinitely.  
‚úÖ Calls `color_cycle()` repeatedly to create a looping animation.  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Graceful Exit on Keyboard Interrupt**  
```python
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pixels.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Turn off LEDs on exit
    pixels.show()
    print("
LEDs turned off. Exiting...")
```
‚úÖ If the user **presses Ctrl+C**, this ensures:  
‚úî The **LEDs turn off**.  
‚úî The **program exits cleanly** with a message.  

---

### **Step 3: Run the Code**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the terminal and navigate to your script folder:  
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/script/
   ```  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script with **sudo** (required for GPIO access):  
   ```bash
   sudo python3 neopixel.py
   ```  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the script. The LEDs will **turn off automatically**.
