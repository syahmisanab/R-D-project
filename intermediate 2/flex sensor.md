## üîé Project Overview

**Lesson Title:** "Measuring Flex with a Bend Sensor on Raspberry Pi"
**Duration:** 30‚Äì45 minutes
**Goal:** Learn how a flex sensor works, how to interface it with a Raspberry Pi using the ADS1115, and how to process and interpret its readings.

A **flex bend sensor** is a type of variable resistor that changes its resistance when bent. The more the sensor bends, the higher the resistance, which can be read as an analog voltage. Since the Raspberry Pi lacks an analog input, we use an **ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** to read the values.

## üîß Materials & Equipment Checklist

- Raspberry Pi (Model 4 or any variant with Raspberry Pi OS installed)
- ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter module
- Flex Bend Sensor
- 10kŒ© Resistor (for voltage divider circuit)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional but recommended)

**Tip:** Ensure your Raspberry Pi is powered and set up before beginning.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Understanding the Flex Bend Sensor**

- A flex sensor is a variable resistor that changes its resistance when bent.
- It works as a **voltage divider** in a circuit.
- As the sensor bends, its resistance increases, altering the voltage output.
- This output is read by an ADC and interpreted by the Raspberry Pi.

### **Step 2: Wiring the Flex Sensor to the ADS1115**

1. **Create a voltage divider circuit:**
   - Connect one end of the flex sensor to **3.3V** on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect the other end to **A0** on ADS1115.
   - Place a **10kŒ© resistor** between A0 and **GND**.

2. **Connect ADS1115 to Raspberry Pi:**
   - VCC ‚Üí 3.3V
   - GND ‚Üí GND
   - SDA ‚Üí GPIO2 (Pin 3)
   - SCL ‚Üí GPIO3 (Pin 5)

**Tip:** Enable I2C on Raspberry Pi using `sudo raspi-config` ‚Üí Interfacing Options ‚Üí I2C ‚Üí Enable.

### **Step 3: Writing the Python Code**

```python
import Adafruit_ADS1x15
import time

# Initialize ADC
gain = 1  # Set gain for ADS1115
adc = Adafruit_ADS1x15.ADS1115()

print("Reading Flex Sensor Values...")

while True:
    value = adc.read_adc(0, gain=gain)  # Read A0 pin
    voltage = (value / 32767.0) * 3.3  # Convert to voltage
    print(f"Raw Value: {value}, Voltage: {voltage:.2f}V")
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### **Step 4: Running the Code**

1. Save the script as `flex_sensor.py`.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python3 flex_sensor.py
   ```
3. Observe the sensor values change as you bend the sensor.

### **Step 5: Experiment & Analyze**

- Try different bending angles and observe how the output changes.
- Use the data to control an LED, servo motor, or log it for further analysis.
- Modify the script to store readings over time for graphing.

## ü§ñ Concepts (Simplified)

### **What is a Flex Sensor?**
A sensor that changes resistance when bent, used in robotics, wearables, and motion tracking.

### **Why Use an ADC?**
Raspberry Pi cannot read analog signals directly, so we use an ADS1115 to convert the sensor's output into digital values.

### **Common Applications of Flex Sensors**
- Motion detection (e.g., gloves for sign language translation)
- Wearable devices
- Robotics and prosthetics
