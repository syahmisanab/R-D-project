# AI-Powered Treasure Hunt (Image Recognition Challenge)

## 🎯 Concept
Teams will program a **Raspberry Pi** with a camera module and AI to recognize specific objects in a scavenger hunt. The team that correctly identifies and captures images of all required objects **first** wins the challenge! 🚀

---

## 🛠 Required Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi** (Any model with camera support)
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**
- Power Supply & SD Card

---

## 🖥️ Software Setup
### 🔹 Image Labeling
📌 **Tool:** [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)  
**Purpose:** Helps in annotating and labeling images for AI training.

### 🔹 Model Training
📌 **Platform:** Google Colab  
**Purpose:** Train AI models using labeled images and deep learning techniques.
