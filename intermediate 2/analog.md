üîé **Project Overview**

**Lesson Title:** "Understanding Analog Signals and ADS1115 on Raspberry Pi"  
**Duration:** 30‚Äì45 minutes  
**Goal:** By the end of this lesson, you will understand the basics of analog signals, the role of ADCs, and how to use the ADS1115 module to interface with analog sensors on a Raspberry Pi.

Modern microcontrollers like Arduino have built-in analog input pins, but Raspberry Pi lacks them. The ADS1115 ADC bridges this gap, allowing the Raspberry Pi to process analog signals for applications like sensors, potentiometers, and more.

üõ† **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Understanding Analog vs. Digital Signals**
1. **Digital Signals:** Represent data as discrete values (0 or 1), used by Raspberry Pi‚Äôs GPIO pins.
2. **Analog Signals:** Represent continuous values (e.g., varying voltages from a sensor) and require conversion for Raspberry Pi.
3. **Role of ADC:** Converts analog signals into a digital format readable by Raspberry Pi.

### **Step 2: What is ADS1115?**
1. ADS1115 is a 16-bit ADC module with four input channels.
2. It communicates with Raspberry Pi using the I2C protocol.
3. It allows reading of voltage-based sensors that output analog signals.

### **Step 3: Connecting ADS1115 to Raspberry Pi**
1. **Wiring Setup:**
   - Connect `VCC` on ADS1115 to `3.3V` on Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect `GND` on ADS1115 to `GND` on Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect `SCL` on ADS1115 to `SCL` on Raspberry Pi (`GPIO3` ‚Äì Pin 5).
   - Connect `SDA` on ADS1115 to `SDA` on Raspberry Pi (`GPIO2` ‚Äì Pin 3).
   - Connect an analog sensor (e.g., potentiometer) to `A0` input on ADS1115.

**Tip:** Ensure I2C is enabled on your Raspberry Pi (`sudo raspi-config` ‚Üí Interfacing Options ‚Üí I2C ‚Üí Enable).

### **Step 4: Understanding ADS1115 Data Output**
1. The ADS1115 provides a 16-bit resolution output (values range from -32,768 to 32,767).
2. The output depends on the selected gain and reference voltage.
3. It can be configured to read single-ended or differential inputs.

### **Step 5: Practice & Experiment**
1. Connect different analog sensors and observe how the output changes.
2. Experiment with different gain settings to understand how they affect readings.
3. Try reading multiple channels simultaneously.

ü§ñ **Concepts (Simplified)**

1. **What is an ADC?**
   - An Analog-to-Digital Converter translates analog voltages into digital values.
2. **Why Raspberry Pi Needs ADS1115?**
   - Raspberry Pi lacks native analog input pins, so an external ADC is required.
3. **Common Analog Sensors that Require an ADC**
   - Potentiometers (voltage dividers)
   - Temperature sensors (e.g., LM35)
   - Light-dependent resistors (LDRs)
   - Pressure sensors
