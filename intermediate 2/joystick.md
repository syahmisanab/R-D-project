## üîé Project Overview

**Lesson Title:** "Interfacing a Joystick Module with Raspberry Pi"
**Duration:** 30‚Äì45 minutes
**Goal:** Learn how to use a joystick module with Raspberry Pi to detect movement and button presses.

Joysticks are commonly used in gaming and robotics. They consist of two potentiometers (one for X-axis and one for Y-axis) and a button. Since Raspberry Pi lacks analog input pins, an external ADC (ADS1115) is required to read the joystick‚Äôs position.

## üîß Materials & Equipment Checklist

1. Raspberry Pi (Model 4 or any variant with Raspberry Pi OS installed)
2. ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter module
3. Joystick module (XY joystick with a push button)
4. Jumper wires
5. Breadboard (optional but recommended)
6. Python installed on Raspberry Pi

**Tip:** Ensure your Raspberry Pi is powered and set up before beginning.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Understanding the Joystick Module**

1. **X-axis and Y-axis:**
   - The joystick has two potentiometers for X and Y movement.
   - Each potentiometer provides an **analog** voltage output, requiring an ADC.

2. **Push Button:**
   - Pressing the joystick down activates a built-in **digital switch**.
   - This button can be read directly by a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin.

### **Step 2: Wiring the Joystick to Raspberry Pi (via ADS1115)**

#### **Joystick Pins:**
- **VCC** ‚Üí 3.3V (Raspberry Pi)
- **GND** ‚Üí GND (Raspberry Pi)
- **VRX (X-axis)** ‚Üí A0 (ADS1115)
- **VRY (Y-axis)** ‚Üí A1 (ADS1115)
- **SW (Button)** ‚Üí Any GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO17 / Pin 11)

#### **ADS1115 to Raspberry Pi:**
- **VCC** ‚Üí 3.3V
- **GND** ‚Üí GND
- **SDA** ‚Üí GPIO2 (Pin 3)
- **SCL** ‚Üí GPIO3 (Pin 5)

**Tip:** Ensure I2C is enabled on your Raspberry Pi (`sudo raspi-config` ‚Üí Interfacing Options ‚Üí I2C ‚Üí Enable).

### **Step 3: Reading Joystick Data in Python**

```python
import time
import board
import busio
import adafruit_ads1x15.ads1115 as ADS
from adafruit_ads1x15.analog_in import AnalogIn
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Initialize I2C and ADC
i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
ads = ADS.ADS1115(i2c)
x_axis = AnalogIn(ads, ADS.P0)
y_axis = AnalogIn(ads, ADS.P1)

# Button setup
button_pin = 17
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(button_pin, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)

while True:
    x_val = x_axis.value  # Read X-axis
    y_val = y_axis.value  # Read Y-axis
    button = GPIO.input(button_pin)  # Read button state
    
    print(f'X: {x_val}, Y: {y_val}, Button: {"Pressed" if button == 0 else "Not Pressed"}')
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

### **Step 4: Understanding the Output**

1. The joystick's X and Y positions will return values between **0 and 65535** (16-bit resolution from ADS1115).
2. The center position should be around **32767**.
3. Moving the joystick fully left/right or up/down will change the values accordingly.
4. The button state will be **0 (Pressed)** or **1 (Not Pressed)**.

## ü§ñ Concepts (Simplified)

1. **How a Joystick Works**
   - Two potentiometers measure movement along X and Y axes.
   - A push button provides a digital on/off signal.

2. **Why We Need ADS1115**
   - Raspberry Pi lacks analog input pins, so an ADC is required to read joystick movement.

3. **Common Uses for Joysticks**
   - Controlling robots, games, and servos.
   - Navigating menus in embedded systems.
