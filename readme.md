## 📝 Lesson Breakdown

### **1️⃣ What is Text Classification? (0 - 15 min)**
AI can **read text and understand its meaning** using Machine Learning.

### **💡 Real-World Examples:**
- **Spam Detector** (AI decides if an email is spam or not)
- **Movie Reviews** (AI detects if a review is positive or negative)
- **Chatbots** (AI understands user questions)

#### **🧠 Brainstorming Activity:**
- How do humans understand text?
- How can AI learn to do the same?

---

### **2️⃣ Classify Text Without AI (15 - 30 min)**
**Game:** Kids manually classify text into categories.

#### **Instructions:**
1. Write different sentences on the board.
2. Ask students to categorize them:
   - "I love pizza!" → **Positive**
   - "The movie was terrible." → **Negative**
   - "Can I buy this?" → **Question**

🤔 **Discussion:** How did they decide? AI does the same using patterns!

### **3️⃣ Hands-on Coding: Simple AI Text Classifier (30 - 45 min)**
#### **🔹 Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

#### **🔹 Python Code for Text Classification**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Training Data
texts = ["I love this!", "This is bad", "Amazing!", "Terrible experience"]
labels = ["positive", "negative", "positive", "negative"]

# Convert Text to Numbers
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Train AI Model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, labels)

# Test AI Model
test_texts = ["I hate this", "So much fun!"]
test_X = vectorizer.transform(test_texts)
predictions = model.predict(test_X)

print(predictions)  # Output: ['negative', 'positive']
```

✅ **Key Learning:**
- Convert text into numbers
- Train AI with examples
- Test AI with new sentences

---

### **4️⃣ Modify & Experiment (45 - 60 min)**
#### **🛠️ Modify the Training Data:**
- Add new words and test AI
- Try longer sentences

**🎯 Challenge:** Trick the AI by giving confusing sentences!

---

### **5️⃣ Project: AI-Powered Chatbot (60 - 90 min)**
#### **🔹 AI Chatbot That Detects Emotions**
```python
responses = {
    "happy": "I'm glad you're feeling happy! 😊",
    "sad": "I'm sorry you're feeling sad. 😢",
    "angry": "Take a deep breath. It's okay to be upset. 😠",
}

while True:
    text = input("How are you feeling? ")
    if text in responses:
        print(responses[text])
    else:
        print("I don't understand that emotion. Try 'happy', 'sad', or 'angry'.")
```

### **🎯 Activity:**
- Modify chatbot to recognize more emotions.
- Make AI understand emotions in longer sentences.

---

### **6️⃣ Final Challenge: AI Sentiment Analyzer (90 - 120 min)**
- Train AI with real movie reviews.
- AI will predict if a review is **positive** or **negative**.

**💡 Bonus Challenge:** Let AI **generate** a short review!

---

## 📌 Summary: What We Learned
✅ AI can **read and classify text**
✅ AI can **train using examples**
✅ AI can **detect emotions in text**
✅ AI chatbots can interact with humans!
