General Idea:

Line Following: Use HuskyLens to track the line (via the Line Tracking mode).
Obstacle Detection: Use the Object Recognition or Block Detection to spot any obstacles that may be in the robot's path.
Obstacle Avoidance: When an obstacle is detected, the robot can temporarily break from the line to avoid it (via predefined movements).
Re-align with the Line: After avoiding the obstacle, the robot can return to following the line.
